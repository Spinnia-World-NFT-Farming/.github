## 🧺 What is Spinnia World?

Spinnia World is a vibrant multiplayer farming metaverse where you grow crops, raise animals, craft items, and socialize — all within a fully NFT-based ecosystem. Each land plot, tool, and decoration is tokenized, giving you full ownership and the ability to earn $SPIN tokens through play.

With cozy vibes, real-time collaboration, and endless customization, Spinnia is more than a game — it’s a lifestyle simulation with blockchain power.
